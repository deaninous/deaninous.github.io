			<h1>Who am I and Why should I be considered for TKHâ€™s upcoming Advanced JavaScript course?</h1>
			<div>
				I am Inoussa Oudraogo. A self-starter and I have been self-studying for quite some time. <br>
				I have have been reading up in fields such as hardware software, as well as networking. And I enjoy doing it!!!. <br>
				So much as I enjoy learning on my own, one waypoint I have been looking forwards to is the chance to polish my skills through a proven and recognized program because without such training, as much as I study and work on personal projects I still felt that I needed that validation, that vote of confidence on my ability in the field. In fact, I have tried taking projects but always shied away at the idea that maybe there might be some key points that I do not fully understand. One such point I keep thinking about is security: I always thought that having my first website compromised could heart my prospects of landing subsequent projects in the future. 
				One field unrelated to security that also keeps haunting me is "best practices". Every time I would work on a project, I would spend quite some time wondering what someone that underwent a formal training would think of it.
				Coming to think of it, I am wondering if the aforementioned concerns come from the fact that most ads I see online require anywhere between three to five years of experience and/or require "proven mastery" of a certain set of frameworks. <br>

				If I were to be accepted to TKH's Advanced javascript program, I would feel confident taking a developer project, I would not feel as much as an imposter as I would feel without said-training.

			<h1>Hobbies & Activities</h1>
				<div>
					I am currently focused on working on my development skills by reading books on systems administration, scripting and web development while keeping an eye out for obvious vulnerabilities.
					<br>
					When I am not catching up on some Coursera/Edx classes or following up on some of the materials I acquired on the above mentioned domains, I like to go swimming or biking. I find those activities relaxing and refreshing.
